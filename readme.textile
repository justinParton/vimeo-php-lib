h1. PHPCLI VIMEO Upload

Using these files, along with the PHPCLI, it is possible to have an automated upload to vimeo from a broadcasting, or any other workstation.

h1. RUN THROUGH

These will be the things you will need:
<pre>
PHPCLI - http://windows.php.net/download/
Vimeo php library - This Repository  ( called vimeo folder from now on)
A Web Server - capable of parsing php.
ftp login - to put the files on the server.

</pre>

h3. 1. Developer keys.

Go Here: <pre>http://vimeo.com/api/applications</pre>
click the link that says "Start a new Application? Start Here"
fill it out the form:
<pre>- it is paramount that you add a callback url to this form; </pre>
                              
        the callback URL is the location where you will store the php-files in this repository on your webserver. This is
not where you will be doing the command line upload, this is just where we initially set the files to get our access keys.

In a couple of days they will approve it. this is by far the longest part of the whole process.


h3. 2.  install  phpCLI 

Install it on the computer system you will be using. i used the installer for windows.
            
- i used the latest version of php for apache. only because i knew i wasn't using a web server. 

( you don't need a webserver or any other software for what we are doing)

- if your using window, pick the installers

h3. 3. Update PATH

Add the location of your php directory to the PATH variable.

The links below will detail the instruction for windows clients: 
<pre>          
windows xp: http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm
windows vista: http://geekswithblogs.net/renso/archive/2009/10/21/how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx
windows 7: http://geekswithblogs.net/renso/archive/2009/10/21/how-to-set-the-windows-path-in-windows-7.aspx 
</pre>

h4. check to make sure everything has been set up right:
                
Open up an command prompt, and enter the command "php". A prompt should automatically follow with the words CLI. 
if you got that, your good to go.  If not, enter the path at the command line, and make sure that your directory to the php folder is 
present, it will be at the end. if not,  close the command line window and reopen it, and execute the path command. if it still doesn't work, you have a php  
installation issue, i had a couple of these and had to reinstall a couple of times before it actually worked itself out. as much as i tried, i never got it working,
it just ended up working itself out.

h3. 4. Upload configuraton (easy part)

 inside your vimeo folder, open index.php in a text editor and change:
Consumer key:  this is that consumer key i talked about in step 1(replace CONSUMER_KEY with the actual "consumer key" given on your vimeo App settings)
Consumer secret: replace CONSUMER_SECRET with the actual "consumer secret" on the vimeo app settings page
         
save index.php and close it. Now upload the entire vimeo folder to the callback url folder on your webserver (make sure cache folder gets uploaded also).

Once you have done that: open up a browser and go to your callback url.
----> click authenticate link 
---------->  it goes to vimeo, comes back to your page automatically  ( the reasons we need a callback url)
--------------> it displays the necessary access keys you need
                               
those login keys are labeled.

h3. ON YOUR DESKTOP

open up the vimeo folder, and open up "upload.php".

look for this line:
<pre>  $vimeo = new phpVimeo('CONSUMER_KEY', 'CONSUMER_SECRET', 'ACCESS_TOKEN', 'ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'); </pre>

change: CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET
with the appropriate keys

And then save the file.

h3. 5.    Execution:

place the vimeo folder in a directory on your hard drive. (i put mine in my video folder)
Go to that folder on the command line and execute <pre>"php upload.php"</pre>
and it will attempt to upload a "ready.mp4" in the same folder to vimeo.com
      
all i did from there was create a batch file to click on that had the commands php upload.php in it and execute it after i do postprocessing
